# ML Project for Finance Portfolio
For the Machine Learning for Finance Portfolio project, I developed a regression-based machine learning model to identify key variables influencing stock returns and recommend optimized investment portfolios. Using Python’s data science libraries—NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib—I collected, processed, and analyzed over 18,000 historical data points from the S&P 1500 index to uncover trends and correlations. To enhance predictive performance, I evaluated multiple modeling techniques, including Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), LASSO regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest algorithms. Combining these quantitative findings with qualitative assessments, I constructed an optimized stock portfolio strategically designed to consistently outperform the broader market.
